"Whenever the crow laid eggs, the snake would eat them up. The crow felt helpless. That evil snake. I must do something. Let me go and talk to him, thought the crow. "+ 
"The next morning, the crow went to the snake and said politely: Please spare my eggs, dear friend. Let us live like good neighbors and not disturb each other."+ 
"Huh! You cannot expect me to go hungry. Eggs are what I eat, replied the snake, in a nasty tone. "+ 
"The crow felt angry and she thought, I must teach that snake a lesson. "+ 
"The very next day, the crow was flying over the Kings palace. She saw the Princess wearing an expensive necklace. Suddenly a thought flashed in her mind and she swooped down, picked up the necklace in her beak and flew off to her nest. "+ 
"When the Princess saw the crow flying off with her necklace, she screamed, Somebody help, the crow has taken my necklace. "+ 
"Soon the palace guards were running around in search of the necklace. Within a short time the guards found the crow. She still sat with the necklace hanging from her beak. "+ 
"The clever crow thought, Now is the time to act. And she dropped the necklace, which fell right into the snakeâ€™s pit of house. "+ 
"When the snake heard the noise, it came out of its pit of house. The palace guards saw the snake. A snake! Kill it! they shouted. With big sticks, they beat the snake and killed it. "+ 
"Then the guards took the necklace and went back to the princess. The crow was happy, Now my eggs will be safe, she thought and led a happy and peaceful life."
